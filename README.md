# CARTO test

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to run the test in your local machine.

### Prerequisites

First of all, you have to install a full Ruby development environment with all headers and RubyGems. You can follow this [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

### Installing

Once you have installed a full Ruby development environment, you can create a new Jekyll site by doing the following:

```
~ $ gem install jekyll bundler
```
Create a new Jekyll site.

```
~ $ jekyll new carto_test
```

Change into your new directory.

```
~ $ cd carto_test
```

Download the files from the repository and copy them into this new directory.

Build the site on the preview server.

```
~/carto_test $ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, you can run the project entering http://localhost:4000 in your browse.
