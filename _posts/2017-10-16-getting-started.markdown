The simplest way to use a visualization created in CARTO on an external site is as follows.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

## Using the CARTO.js LibraryPermalink
CARTO.js can be used to embed a visualization you have designed using CARTOâ€™s user interface, or to dynamically create visualizations from scratch, using your data. If you want to create new maps on your webpage, jump to Creating a visualization from scratch. If you already have maps on your webpage and want to add CARTO visualizations to them, read Adding CARTO layers to an existing map.

You can also use the CARTO APIs to create visualizations programmatically. This can be useful when the visualizations react to user interactions. To read more about it, jump to Creating visualizations at runtime.
